</dl><b>Remarks</b><dl>
<dd> The Unicode Standard defines the following: <p> A surrogate pair is a coded character representation for a single abstract character that consists of a sequence of two code units, where the first unit of the pair is a high-surrogate and the second is a low-surrogate. A high-surrogate is a Unicode code point in the range U+D800 through U+DBFF and a low-surrogate is a Unicode code point in the range U+DC00 through U+DFFF.</p>
<p> A combining character sequence is a combination of a base character and one or more combining characters. A surrogate pair can represent a base character or a combining character. A combining character can be spacing or nonspacing. A spacing combining character takes up a spacing position by itself, when rendered; whereas, a nonspacing combining character does not. Diacritics are an example of nonspacing combining characters.</p>
<p> A modifier letter is a free-standing spacing character that, like a combining character, indicates modifications of a preceding letter.</p>
<p> An enclosing mark is a nonspacing combining character that surrounds all previous characters up to and including a base character.</p>
<p> A format character is a character that is not normally rendered but that affects the layout of text or the operation of text processes.</p>
<p> The Unicode Standard defines several variations to some punctuation marks. For example, a hyphen can be one of several code values that represent a hyphen, such as U+002D (hyphen-minus) or U+00AD (soft hyphen) or U+2010 (hyphen) or U+2011 (non-breaking hyphen). The same is true for dashes, space characters, and quotation marks.</p>
<p> The Unicode Standard also assigns codes to representations of decimal digits that are specific to a given script or language; for example, U+0030 (digit zero) and U+0660 (Arabic-Indic digit zero).</p>
<p> This enumeration is based on The Unicode Standard, Version 3.1.</p>
<p> For more information, see The Unicode Standard at http://www.unicode.org.</p>
<p> This enumeration is used to support  <a href="../../System/types/Char.html">Char</a> methods, such as <b>IsUpper</b>.</p>
