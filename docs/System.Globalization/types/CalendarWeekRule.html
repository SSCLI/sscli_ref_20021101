</dl><b>Remarks</b><dl>
<dd> These calendar week rules depend on the  <a href="../../System/types/DayOfWeek.html">DayOfWeek</a> value that is designated as the first day of the week. The  <a href="../../System.Globalization/types/DateTimeFormatInfo.html#FirstDayOfWeek">DateTimeFormatInfo.FirstDayOfWeek</a> property provides the default value for a culture, but any  <a href="../../System/types/DayOfWeek.html">DayOfWeek</a> value can be specified as the first day of the week in the  <a href="../../System.Globalization/types/Calendar.html#GetWeekOfYear(System.DateTime,System.Globalization.CalendarWeekRule,System.DayOfWeek)">Calendar.GetWeekOfYear</a> method.<p> The first week based on the  <a href="#FirstDay">CalendarWeekRule.FirstDay</a> value can have one to seven days. The first week based on the  <a href="#FirstFullWeek">CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek</a> value always has seven days. The first week based on the  <a href="#FirstFourDayWeek">CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek</a> value can have four to seven days.</p>
<p> For example, in the Gregorian calendar, suppose that the first day of the year (January 1) falls on a Tuesday and the designated first day of the week is Sunday. Selecting  <a href="#FirstFullWeek">CalendarWeekRule.FirstFullWeek</a> defines the first Sunday (January 6) as the beginning of the first week of the year. The first five days of the year are considered part of the last week of the previous year. In contrast, selecting  <a href="#FirstFourDayWeek">CalendarWeekRule.FirstFourDayWeek</a> defines the first day of the year (January 1) as the beginning of the first week of the year because there are more than four days from January 1 to the day before the following Sunday.</p><br><br><table border="1" width="90%" style="border-collapse: collapse">
